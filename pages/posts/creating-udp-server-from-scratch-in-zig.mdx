description: In this post we'll build a UDP server from scratch in Zig. We'll cover how to create a socket, bind it to a specific address and port, and listen for messages.

At a high level this is how UDP servers work:

1. Create a socket
2. Bind the socket to a specific address and port (through the OS)
3. Listen for messages at that specific address and port

Here's how we do these steps in Zig:

## Create a socket

We need to tell the OS to create a socket via the \`std.os.socket\` function.

Here's it's signature:

```typescript
fn socket(domain: u32, socket_type: u32, protocol: u32) SocketError!socket_t
```

`domain` refers to the IP address family: i.e. IPv4, or IPv6.

`socket_type` is exactly what it sounds like. We'll use DGRAM (datagram) to signal we're making a UDP socket.

`protocol` is for when we support multiple protocols for our server. For our simple one we only support 1 protocol: UDP. By passing a 0 we're telling the system to use the inferred protocol.

We get a `socket_t` from this to represent a socket.

```typescript
const sock = try std.os.socket(std.os.AF.INET, std.os.SOCK.DGRAM, 0);
```

## bind the socket

Next we need to tell the OS to bind the socket to a specific port and address so we can listen for messages.

Here's the function signature for bind

```typescript
fn bind(sock: socket_t, addr: *const sockaddr, len: socklen_t) BindError!void
// addr is *const T where T is one of the sockaddr
```

`sock` is the socket we created from earlier (remember the `socket_t` )

`addr` is a pointer to a `sockaddr` struct

`len` is the size of the `Address` struct. Use the `getOsSockLen` method from our `Address` instance.

---

Let's talk about how to get the `sockaddr` instance:

First we need to give the socket an address via: `parseIP4` Here's the function signature:

```typescript
fn parseIp4(buf: []const u8, port: u16) !Address
```

the `buf` is the IP (idk why it's called a buf here)

From this we get an `Address` instance.

Address looks like this:

```typescript
pub const Address = extern union {
    any: os.sockaddr,
    in: Ip4Address,
    in6: Ip6Address,
...
}
```

We can use the `.any` to access the socket address!

It needs a pointer so be sure to pass the address (via `&` )

---

We have this so far:

```typescript
const std = @import("std");
const os = std.os;

pub fn main() !void {
    const sock = try std.os.socket(std.os.AF.INET, std.os.SOCK.DGRAM, 0);
    const parsed_address = try std.net.Address.parseIp4("127.0.0.1", 3000);
    try os.bind(socket, address.any, address.getOsSockLen());

}
```

## Listen for messages

We'll use the `recvfrom` provided by the OS. This will get us the data from the socket without the address from the client.

The signature looks like this:

```typescript
fn recvfrom(
    sockfd: socket_t,
    buf: []u8,
    flags: u32,
    src_addr: ?*sockaddr,
    addrlen: ?*socklen_t,
) RecvFromError!usize
```

It needs a few things:

1. what socket we're wanting to listen to (`sockfd`)
2. A buffer to put the bytes it gets from the stream

The rest of the args from the signature aren't needed in this example.

Be sure to stick recvfrom in a persisted loop to keep listening for data.

## Code example

```typescript
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;
const net = std.net;
const os = std.os;

test "create a socket" {
    var socket = try Socket.init("127.0.0.1", 3000);
    try expect(@TypeOf(socket.socket) == std.os.socket_t);
}

const Socket = struct {
    address: std.net.Address,
    socket: std.os.socket_t,

    fn init(ip: []const u8, port: u16) !Socket {
        const parsed_address = try std.net.Address.parseIp4(ip, port);
        const sock = try std.os.socket(std.os.AF.INET, std.os.SOCK.DGRAM, 0);
        errdefer os.closeSocket(sock);
        return Socket{ .address = parsed_address, .socket = sock };
    }

    fn bind(self: *Socket) !void {
        try os.bind(self.socket, &self.address.any, self.address.getOsSockLen());
    }

    fn listen(self: *Socket) !void {
        var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;

        while (true) {
            const received_bytes = try std.os.recvfrom(self.socket, buffer[0..], 0, null, null);
            std.debug.print("Received {d} bytes: {s}\n", .{ received_bytes, buffer[0..received_bytes] });
        }
    }
};
```

## Interacting with the server

We can run `nc -u 127.0.0.1 3000` to interact with the UDP server. Be sure to pass the -u flag to tell netcat that this is a UDP connection as it defaults to TCP.
