`mkdir ~/bin`

Now let's go to it:

`cd ~/bin` and create a file `text.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

MESSAGE=$1
# Replace with their number (be sure to include the +1)
PHONE_NUMBER=+11234567

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
     echo "Usage: $0 MESSAGE"
     exit 1
fi

osascript -e "tell application \"Messages\" to send \"$MESSAGE\" to buddy \"    $PHONE_NUMBER\""

```

Now we need to make the file executable:  
`chmod +x text.sh`

Now we can use it!

`./text.sh "I LOVE YOU"`

### Alias

To alias it so that you could say something like `rach "I LOVE YOU"`

Add to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` the following:

```bash
# local bin
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
alias rach='text.sh'
```

Now we can say `rach "I LOVE YOU"` and it sends!
