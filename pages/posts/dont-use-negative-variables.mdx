Between the title & this: **_Use positive variable and function names_**

which was easier to read?

Here's another example:

```typescript
const isNotActive = user.status !== 'active';

if (!isNotActive) {
  // they're online
}

if (isNotActive) {
  // they're offline
}
```

Compared to this:

```typescript
const isActive = user.status === 'active';

if (isActive) {
  // they're online
}

if (!isActive) {
  // they're offline
}
```

Did you notice the cognitive effort you had to do when negating the negative statement?

When we have a boolean variable - a teammate will likely need to check the opposite. Which means they'd have to negate the negative ðŸ« 

We want to be sympathetic towards each other and keep the cognitive load for reading code as low as possible. **Keep your variable/ function names positive!**
