## What's a closure?

Closures are like a backpack for functions. The backpack holds all of the values the function needs from its original environment, even if it's called in a different place. **It gives functions access to all of its belongings no matter where it's called**.

Here's a simple code example:

```typescript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // Outputs: 1
counter(); // Outputs: 2
counter(); // Outputs: 3
```

The inner function has a closure (or backpack) that allows it to "remember" the value of count no matter where we call it!

This is a super powerful tool that makes a lot of things possible!

## Closures in React

Here's the "React" version of the above code

```typescript
export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function updateCount() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return <button onClick={updateCount}>{count}</button>;
}
```

The _closure_ is what allows `updateCount` to **remember** and access the value of `count` and the `setCount` function.

## React Rendering - a snapshot of the component

```typescript
export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function updateCount() {
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(count); // what do we get here?
  }

  return <button onClick={updateCount}>{count}</button>;
}
```

Now what happens when we log the value of `count` after updating it?

It may surprise you - but it's still whatever the value was before you updated it! (i.e. 0 after first clicked)

The reason: React doesn't immediately update `count` so we are left with a _stale_ value - in this case, what the count originally was before the update.

Instead, `count` (state) won't be updated until React **renders** the component again.

This is because <a href="https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot" target="_blank">state behaves like a snapshot</a>
