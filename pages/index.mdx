Hi there! I'm Reilly O'Donnell, a Senior Frontend Engineer with a passion for collaboration, pair programming, and teaching.

I'm currently working at Acuity, Inc., where I've been recognized for optimizing app performance and delivering UI improvements on a large-scale, multinational project using **React**, **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, and **Cypress/Playwright**.

I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and enjoy mentoring fellow developers, sharing best practices, and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. I'm excited to connect with you and discuss how we can build the future together. [Let's talk!](mailto:odonnell.reilly.j@gmail.com)
